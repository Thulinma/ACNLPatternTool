      Changing to ACNL format will produce the following changes:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>You're restricted to colors and design styles that the previous game (ACNL) had available.</li>
      <li>If you're using colors or designs that are not available, the tool will automatically go to the nearest available for you. <strong>This may lower the quality of your design!</strong></li>
      <li>Paint By Letter color maps are disabled, and QR codes are made available again.</li>
      <li><strong>Note: QR codes are not shareable or editable inside ACNH through other means than QR codes!</strong></li>
