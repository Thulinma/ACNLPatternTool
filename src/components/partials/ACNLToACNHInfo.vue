      Changing to ACNH format will produce the following changes:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Allow you to use colors and design styles that are not available in ACNL format</li>
      <li><strong>QR Codes are no longer available</strong>; the game itself does not support these when using ACNH-specific colors/designs.</li>
      <li>Instead, Paint By Letter (PBL) color maps are available to easily copy to the game by hand.</li>
      <li>Converting images in ACNH mode is not yet fully optimised to make best use of the available colors. Improvements soon!</li>
    </ul>
