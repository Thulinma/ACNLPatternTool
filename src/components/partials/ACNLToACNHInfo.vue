      Changing to ACNH format will produce the following changes:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>QR Codes are no longer available. The game will only read ACNL QR Codes.</strong></li>
      <li>Paint by letter (PBL) color maps will be available to copy by hand in game.</li>
      <li>Allow you to use colors that are not available in ACNL.</li>
      <li>Converting images in ACNH mode may produce colors that are not directly selectable via in-game UI.</li>
      <li>PBL color maps will always select the closest colors you can get in game.</li>
      <li>Converting images in ACNH mode is not yet fully optimised to make best use of the available colors. Improvements soon!</li>
    </ul>
