How? See this [handy list of collections using IIIF](https://iiif.io/community/) (scroll down to see them all): you’ll find friends like the National Gallery of Art, the Frick Collection, Yale University, and the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, to name just a few. Search their collections to find a favorite. Then, dive deep with this how-to on [finding a IIIF manifest](https://iiif.io/explainers/using_iiif_resources/#finding-a-iiif-manifest-url).

Tip: Before you use a IIIF manifest, be sure to check the institution’s terms of use and any relevant information in the manifest itself  to make sure you’re following their rules about important stuff like copyright and image reuse.  **Remember that you can only put other people’s content into Animal Crossing if you have their permission.**

But wait, what is IIIF? So glad you asked! IIIF stands for International Image Interoperability Framework, and it’s a technology for showing art online—and creating image tools like this one. More and more museums, libraries, and archives are making their images available using IIIF. At Getty, we’re big on IIIF and hope you will be too.
