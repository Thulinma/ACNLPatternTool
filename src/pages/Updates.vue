  <h1>Changelog</h1>

    <dt>October 17, 2020</dt>
    <dd>
      <ul>
        <li>Sorry for the long wait! We totally overdid the amount of content for a single update, and we still don't feel it's "perfect", but it's close enough that we're comfortable releasing this. Hopefully we'll be doing short and sweet updates from here on forward. ðŸ¤ž</li>
        <li>What amounts to effectively a complete redesign of the while website/tool, graphically. We hope you like it.</li>
        <li>Pagination capabilities for the browse function (no longer stuck only viewing page 1!)</li>
        <li>Browsing patterns now caches results and has history, which should speed things up significantly.</li>
        <li>Improved mobile-readiness</li>
        <li>Added a modified version of the xbrz library, which is the pattern algorithm the game itself uses for upscaling. That means the pattern previews will now actually look like they do in-game. Yay!</li>
        <li>Support for ACNH format patterns (both reading and writing) as well as loading decrypted ACNH savegames directly into the tool</li>
        <li>For coders: the ACNLFormat class documentation was updated with information extracted from the official NSO application</li>
        <li>Added accurate 3D previews for both ACNL and ACNH patterns in ACNH-style.</li>
        <li>Added a fancy 3D easel preview for non-pro patterns</li>
        <li>Added capability to convert patterns between ACNL and ACNH formats with one click (may lose some detail in the process, so please do keep backups of your originals!)</li>
        <li>Added support for an ACNH-style color picker. This will also show you the nearest color in the in-game GUI. Sliders are accurate to within less than 0.1% error.</li>
        <li>Support for exporting ACNH-format paint-by-numbers images. These show how to re-create a pattern in game in a straightforward and easy to read way. Simply put the editor into ACNH mode and click the QR-code button: it will export a paint-by-numbers graphic instead of a QR code.</li>
        <li>Added a few more advanced drawing tools, like brush sizes.</li>
        <li>Added saturation slider during image conversion, for last-minute saturation tweaks.</li>
        <li>Tons of other little "under the hood" improvements/fixes/etc! Check our <a href="https://github.com/Thulinma/ACNLPatternTool/commits/master">github</a> for full history.</li>
      </ul>

    <dd>
      <ul>
        <li>Corrected creator/town name to be max 9 chars instead of 8</li>
        <li>Added helpful guidelines in the pattern grid</li>
        <li>Fixed bug with creator gender being forced to female, causing male players to not be able to edit their own patterns in ACNL anymore</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>March 22, 2020</dt>
    <dd>
      <ul>
        <li>Made it easier/more obvious to change pattern title and creator info</li>
        <li>Fixed all known causes of 3999 error. There were SO MANY. ðŸ˜­</li>
        <li>Also fixed all old patterns retroactively. Just generate a new QR code for them and it should work now!</li>
        <li>Added moderation tools so a mod team can approve/reject patterns and keep the database clean-ish.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug that allowed overwriting the transparent color</li>
        <li>Added NSFW search toggle</li>
        <li>The image cropper now defaults to using the whole image (if possible)</li>
        <li>Browse page should now work on iOS/Safari again... and allow opening patterns in new tabs! Yay!</li>
        <li>Added support for importing ACNL savegames with the Welcome Amiibo DLC installed.</li>
        <li>Improved ACNL savegame loading to also read the patterns from Able Sisters, not just players 1 and 2.</li>
        <li>Updated Discord link to point directly to the information channel as opposed to the main chat channel</li>
      </ul>
